**Hello, my name is Tiago Sabadini** 

Iâ€™ve been working with web development for over 16 years, using languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and Python. Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ve founded three companies: a website agency, a software house, and the largest car subscription platform in Brazil, byecar. Iâ€™ve led technology teams, provided technical consulting, supported budget planning, and contributed to product development, among other roles.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been studying Web3 with the goal of gaining new knowledge to build innovative tech-based businesses.
